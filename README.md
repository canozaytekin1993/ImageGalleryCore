## ASP.NET Core codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the RealWorld spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with ASP.NET Core (with Feature orientation) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the ASP.NET Core community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the RealWorld repo.
